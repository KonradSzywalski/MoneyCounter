The Moneycounter project is an application created in python and using The Jupyter Notebook. The application downloads a previously taken photo of coins, and then counts them and the sum of their denominations. During this project, it was required to properly process photos as well as select and use filters that allow us to extract the properties that interesting to us. My choice fell on the Skimage library. The program required the creation of a segmentation and indexation function. Progaram additionally counts the percentage of the area where the coins are located in relation to the entire photo and the Feret, Haralick and Blair-Bliss ratios.
